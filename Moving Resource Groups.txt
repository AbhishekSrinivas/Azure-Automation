Move resources to new resource group or subscription:
-----------------------------------------------------

Checklist before moving resources
There are some important steps to perform before moving a resource. By verifying these conditions, you can avoid errors.

1) The service must enable the ability to move resources. See the list below for information about which services enable moving resources.

2) The destination subscription must be registered for the resource provider of the resource being moved. If not, you receive an error stating that the subscription is not registered for a resource type. You might encounter this problem when moving a resource to a new subscription, but that subscription has never been used with that resource type. To learn how to check the registration status and register resource providers.

3) If you are moving App Service app, you have reviewed App Service limitations.

4) If you are moving resources associated with Recovery Services, you have reviewed the Recovery Services limitations

5) If you are moving resources deployed through classic model, you have reviewed Classic deployment limitations.


Services that enable move

For now, the services that enable moving to both a new resource group and subscription are:

API Management
App Service apps (web apps) - see App Service limitations
Automation
Batch
CDN
Cloud Services - see Classic deployment limitations
Data Factory
DNS
DocumentDB
HDInsight clusters
IoT Hubs
Key Vault
Media Services
Mobile Engagement
Notification Hubs
Operational Insights
Redis Cache
Scheduler
Search
Service Bus
Storage
Storage (classic) - see Classic deployment limitations
SQL Database server - The database and server must reside in the same resource group. When you move a SQL server, all of its databases are also moved.
Virtual Machines
Virtual Machines (classic) - see Classic deployment limitations
Virtual Networks


Services that do not enable move
The services that currently do not enable moving a resource are:

Application Gateway
Application Insights
Express Route
Recovery Services vault - also do not move the Compute, Network, and Storage resources associated with the Recovery Services vault, see Recovery Services limitations.
Virtual Machines Scale Sets
Virtual Networks (classic) - see Classic deployment limitations
VPN Gateway



Use PowerShell

=========================================================================================================================================================
To move existing resources to another resource group or subscription, use the Move-AzureRmResource command.

The first example shows how to move one resource to a new resource group.

$resource = Get-AzureRmResource -ResourceName ExampleApp -ResourceGroupName OldRG
Move-AzureRmResource -DestinationResourceGroupName NewRG -ResourceId $resource.ResourceId

=========================================================================================================================================================


The second example shows how to move multiple resources to a new resource group.

$webapp = Get-AzureRmResource -ResourceGroupName OldRG -ResourceName ExampleSite
$plan = Get-AzureRmResource -ResourceGroupName OldRG -ResourceName ExamplePlan
Move-AzureRmResource -DestinationResourceGroupName NewRG -ResourceId $webapp.ResourceId, $plan.ResourceId


To move to a new subscription, include a value for the DestinationSubscriptionId parameter.

You are asked to confirm that you want to move the specified resources.

Confirm 
Are you sure you want to move these resources to the resource group


'/subscriptions/{guid}/resourceGroups/newRG' the resources:


/subscriptions/{guid}/resourceGroups/destinationgroup/providers/Microsoft.Web/serverFarms/exampleplan
/subscriptions/{guid}/resourceGroups/destinationgroup/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/examplesite


[Y] Yes  [N] No  [S] Suspend  [?] Help (default is "Y"): y

Example Script to move resources to another subscription:
--------------------------------------------------------


$varun=Login-AzureRmAccount

$varuns=Get-AzureRmSubscription -SubscriptionId "3b1a7b6a-8078-43ed-b285-220a16bb8e36"



#$gulab=Login-AzureRmAccount

#$gulabs=Get-AzureRmSubscription -SubscriptionId "12b53db0-8384-4dd7-8ea7-4fabaacb0b0e"





$webapp = Get-AzureRmResource -ResourceGroupName 'componentbuy' -ResourceName mongodbvm01 


$plan = Get-AzureRmResource -ResourceGroupName componentbuy -ResourceName mongodbvm01

Move-AzureRmResource -DestinationResourceGroupName componentbuy1 -ResourceId $webapp.ResourceId -DestinationSubscriptionId "12b53db0-8384-4dd7-8ea7-4fabaacb0b0e"
